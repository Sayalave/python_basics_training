# Python basics training

## Objective
This training covers Python basics using examples from data analysis with focus on the Pandas library, which is a powerful tool that can be used across multiple functions. The practical goal of the training is to replace any usage of Excel with Python, as well as to explore additional functionalities to load, transform, analyze, and visualize data. The training will use Jupyter to execute Python and if there is enough interest it can potentially cover GitHub basics.

## Prerequisites
The only prerequisites for the traiing is Python 3.7. Throughout the training, we will add libraries to requirements.txt for additional Python libraries that will be used. 

## Install Python 3.7
* Open the terminal. If you donâ€™t how to open the terminal, here is a [video}(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw7Nd67_aFw)
* Install Homebrew:
``` /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
* Install Python: 
```
brew install python
```

## Setup a virtual environment
* Open the terminal. 
* Go to your home directory in the terminal: 
```
cd
```
* If you want your home directory to shown in the Finder sidebar, you can follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A69alGX1Sk)
